Somewhere on their way, between Stockholm and Gothenburg they got really frightened. They heard something in the woods… It was a bloodthirsty, giant bear!!!!! Which the Stockholmpeople had gene manipulated. The bear had a small furry cuddly dog called Ulf that barks in Swedish: «URF, URF».
And why is he a villain you may think? He has a volcanic hammer.
