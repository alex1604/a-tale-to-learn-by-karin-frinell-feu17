They traveled through high mountains and rough seas. They won battles against men and beings they did not even know the name of. 
They haven't had a warm meal for weeks, actually not a meal at all, and every night was colder than the night before. Also, after so many days without having a shower, they kind of stank a little. After a while of stinking they began to give
eachother names according to everyones particular stink. One was called "pig", another was called "dogpoo", and so on.
